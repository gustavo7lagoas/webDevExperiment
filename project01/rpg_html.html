    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Forget about all those video games. That was not the way it started.
      Firstly we have the boardgames where battles between fictional armies
      happened and there was a winner. One day, someone have the idea of being
      one of the armies soldiers instead being the army commander. And after
      that people started to get together each one representing only one
      character
